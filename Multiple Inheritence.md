# Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python
## NAME: MONISHA P
## REF NO: 25018486
This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, and Division — using three classes.

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

## 💻 Program 

class Calculation1:
    
    def Summation(self, a, b):
    
        return a + b


class Calculation2:
    
    def Subtraction(self, a, b):
    
        return a - b


class Derived(Calculation1, Calculation2):
    
    def Division(self, a, b):
    
        if b != 0:
        
            return a / b
        
        else:
        
            return "Division by zero not possible"


a = int(input("Enter first number: "))

b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

obj = Derived()

print("Addition :", obj.Summation(a, b))

print("Subtraction :", obj.Subtraction(a, b))

print("Division :", obj.Division(a, b))

## Output Example

Enter first number: 20

Enter second number: 10

Addition : 30

Subtraction : 10

Division : 2.0
## Result
Thus, a Python program using Multiple Inheritance to perform Addition, Subtraction, and Division was successfully written and executed.
